Gem store - Ana

- Requirements: 

The Gem Store shall allow registered users to purchase and sell in-app currency (Gems) for real money. These Gems can be used later to acquire stocks.  

Buying gems: 

The user will scroll through a list of Gem Deals that could be permanent or special (available for a set period of time). The Gem Deals consist of a title, the number of gems the user shall receive and the price in real money.  After choosing an offer, the user shall be asked to choose a bank account the money will be subtracted from. After selecting the desired bank account, the user will be able to press “BUY”, which will finalize the transaction. In Guest mode, the user shall only be allowed to see the Gem Deals. 

Selling gems:  

The exchange rate will be displayed (100 Gems = 1 Euro) and the user shall be allowed to input the number of gems they want to sell in exchange for real money. The user will then be able to press “SELL”, and the system shall validate that the input is greater than 0 and that the user has sufficient funds. If the input is invalid, a specific error message indicating the problem will be displayed. If there are no problems, the user shall be asked to choose a bank account the money will be deposited into. After selecting the desired bank account, the user will be able to press “SELL” again, which will finalize the transaction. In Guest mode, the user shall not be allowed to sell Gems.
